ArtE-ephys Version 0.5

TODO:

-Figure out how most people do version numbers.  What source files get them?  Where do they show up?

-ArtE programs need to be split into multiple repositories (probably on github).  And the common files need to be factored out into a library.  This will be hard.

-Remake spike viewer.  The old one doesn't compile anymore.

-Switch all wire data from hand-marshaled to protocol buffer.

-Debug the 10% spike-dropping issue.

-Multiplexing?

-Config files should be in ~/.arte/ NOT in the build directory.
